MyMCU
=====

What is it?
-----------
Arduino and client programs to interface my HID-based flight sim controls to various flight simulators.

Why would I care?
-----------------
You probably wouldn't, but if you find yourself doing something similar, it could be useful as reference.

Why 'MyMCU'? It doesn't even make sense
---------------------------------------
Initially it was supposed to be MyMCP (Multifunctional Control Panel) but somewhere early on I mixed up MCP with MCU and it stuck :|.
